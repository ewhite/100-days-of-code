# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday, January 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Set up terminal and local development environment.
1. Created iTerm profile and customized to my hearts content. See 
[iterm view](./log-resources/iterm-setup.png) image if you are curious.
2. Updated Intellij to use the same settings.

**Thoughts:** Although it may not feel like much, it is really exciting to 
have a fully custom set up for the first time.
