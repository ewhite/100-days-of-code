# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday, January 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Set up terminal and local development environment.
1. Created iTerm profile and customized to my hearts content. See 
[iterm view](./log-resources/iterm-setup.png) image if you are curious.
2. Updated Intellij to use the same settings.

**Thoughts:** Although it may not feel like much, it is really exciting to 
have a fully custom set up for the first time.

### Day 1: Tuesday, January 7th, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Researched Google Home API and Google Actions API. 
Forked and tried (and failed) to get some prebuilt Smart Home actions 
running.

**Thoughts:** There is a lot involved in Google's deployment 
infrastructure. The whole Google Cloud Suite is unfamiliar to me, and 
although I had hoped to accomplish more today, I'm beginning to realize
that using this new stack will consume a not insignificant portion of
my time. We'll see, I suppose. I'm eager to do some actual coding.

**Goals for tomorrow:**
1. Either get something working with the prebuilt smart home actions or
create a minimal setup of my own talking with Google's servers.
